# Anti Tic-Tac-Toe Game

By "Anti Tic-Tac-Toe", we mean the player who gets 3-in-a-row loses.

The first player is X. As the first player has a disadvantage, when X gets 3 in a row, O has to make one more move. If, in this final move, O makes 3 in a row as well, the outcome would be a draw.

There are 4 possible players to pick from: _human_, _random_, _weak AI_ and _strong AI_. Both AIs are coded with plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) without any hand-coded heuristics. You can play against an AI by picking "Human" as one of the players, or you can play with a friend by picking "Human" for both sides.
